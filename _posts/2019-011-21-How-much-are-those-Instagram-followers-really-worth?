**This is my first data science project!**

For my project I wanted to see if the amount of Instagram followers an artist has truly translates into revenue, and if experience plays a larger role. I used data from Pollstar's 2018 Top North American Touring Artists, and added on the data about how many followers (from Instagram) and how long the artist has been active (from Wikipedia). I found that Instagram has much less sway than I origionally thought, and you can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@roseemma324/how-much-are-those-instagram-followers-really-worth-3cba943dc963?sk=7863558204eb20462a312742d81d350f).
