title: How much are those Instagram followers really worth?
---

##This is my first data science project!

For my project I wanted to see if the amount of Instagram followers an artist has truly translates into revenue, and if experience 
plays a larger role. I used data from Pollstar's 2018 Top North American Touring Artists, and added on the data about how many 
followers (from Instagram) and how long the artist has been active (from Wikipedia). I found that Instagram has much less sway 
than I origionally thought, and you can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@roseemma324/how-much-are-those-instagram-followers-really-worth-3cba943dc963?sk=7863558204eb20462a312742d81d350f).
And you can find the origional dataset and my notebook [here] (https://github.com/emma-rose22/Music-Instagram-Analysis)
