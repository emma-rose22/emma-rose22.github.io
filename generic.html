              Given 65 million rows of trade data, in a non-English language,
              the task was to create a pipeline that could flag an individual
              trade as containing materials that could be used in the nuclear
              fuel production cycle, and return a dataset of flagged data. Like
              finding a needle in a haystack, my team tried a variety of methods
              to reach our goal. Before reaching our end product, I lead
              research into methods of working with positive/unlabeled data.
              Myself and my team implemented many variations of ML methods using
              the ROC AUC score as a metric. I was solely responsible for all
              clustering experimentation, contributed to the massive cleaning
              process and implementated our pipeline in an Amazon EC2 instance
              which pulled from Amazon S3 Buckets. Read an in depth analysis of

              Using FEMA data to Track and Predict Flooding

              Inspired by reports that global warming causes increased flooding,
              in this solo project I saught to find that trend in the FEMA
              Claims data, and use that to predict future flood heights. After
              sampling from a 2.4 million row dataset and dropping unnecessary
              columns, I used applied Ridge Regression, Random Forest
              Regression, and XGBoost to a dataset of ~36,000 rows. I expanded
              my learning as I ran into complications such as FEMA not
              collecting data on flood heights, leakage, and specific natural
              disasters causing an overwhelming amount of claims. Follow me

            <p>
              In one week, myself and a cross-functional team built an app
              designed to assist medical marijuana users. My role was to build
              the recommendation system with another data science student. The
              user provided a variety of variables they are looking for,
              including ailments they want relief from, preferred flavors, and
              other desired feelings. We used TF-IDF to vectorize the medical
              effects all the strains in our database. Then, using the user's
              medical ailments, we created ten suggested strains using the
              TF-IDF matrix and k-Nearest Neighbors. This prioritized medical
              benefits above all other input, before filtering out some of those
              ten strains to meet (if possible) the user's desired flavors and
              effects. The final product contains this recommendation system, as
              well as a user profile, login, saved strains, and a search bar
              allowing you to query our entire 3000+ strain database. These
              features were created by the web component of our team in just
              five days. You can find my code creating the recommendation system

              After spending time performing original music, I was very curious
              to see if data backed up the assumption that increasing your
              Instagram followers leads to an increase in profit. Using the 2018
              Top 200 North American Tours data, I found that while the outlying
              highest earners have a massive amount of followers, musicians
              without just a few thousand followers were able to charge the
              highest ticket prices. Seeing that these musicians tended to be
              older, I went on to explore how the oldest musicians compared with
              those musicians with the most followers. This was an exercise in
              data wrangling, cleaning, merging and visualization. You can find

              As a quick project to explore the algorithms behind common data
              science methods, I decided to recreate the k-Nearest Neighbors
              algorithm from scratch. This is a very common clustering algorithm
              that falls into the category of unsupervised machine learning.
